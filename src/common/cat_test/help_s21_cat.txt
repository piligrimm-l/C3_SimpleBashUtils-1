       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -A, --show-all

       -b, --number-nonblank
              number nonempty output lines, overrides -n

       -E, --show-ends
              display $ at end of each line

       -n, --number
              number all output lines

       -s, --squeeze-blank
              suppress repeated empty output lines

       -t     equivalent to -vT

       -T, --show-tabs
              display TAB characters as ^I

       -u     (ignored)

       -v, --show-nonprinting
              use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB

EXIT STATUS
     The s21_cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The command:

           s21_cat file1

     will print the contents of file1 to the standard output.

     The command:

           s21_cat file1 file2 > file3

     will sequentially print the contents of file1 and file2 to the file file3, trunscating file3 if it
     already exists.

     The command:

           s21_cat file1 - file2 - file3

     will print the contents of file1, print data it receives from the standard input until it
     receives an EOF (`^D') character, print the contents of file2, read and output contents of the
     standard input again, then finally output the contents of file3.  Note that if the standard input
     referred to a file, the second dash on the command-line would have no effect, since the entire
     contents of the file would have already been read and printed by s21_cat when it encountered the
     first `-' operand.
